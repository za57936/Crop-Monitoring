# Crop-Monitoring

In this, I have used Arduino nano with temperature & humidity sensor-DHT22 & soil moisture
sensor-YL69 to monitor the crop conditions. This data has been sent to cloud-Thingspeak to process &
take necessary actions like turning water motor on, sending updates to the farmer via SMS & email. Also
detecting if any intruder comes, turning on the buzzer alarm. using image classification in python.
